                  Instead of producing the image myself, I tried to manipulate with Volkova's painting in a collage manner. I am not sure it works perfectly for me, especially keeping in mind what imagery I planned in sketches, but considering the fact that this poster employs a different part of her body of work (meaning not sculptural), it starts to make sense.

                  Sebastian told me my previous version looks like the 60s book cover with bear claws traces, and proposed me to replace vector hand-drawn torn paper texture to real one. Instead, I used some pieces from Volkova's painting again. Maybe to redesign later. Reminds me of layered wallpaper though.

             Last poster layed out as a photograph. After a huge gap, I decided to finalise everything before assessment. I love how this photographic nature of an image (in comparison with scanned one) contributes to the perception of volume, especially the gel piece with its semi-transparent texture and bigger shadow. All at once every part starts working as an opposition of an empty shell and a solid inside.
