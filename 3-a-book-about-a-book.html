        <div class="chat-text">Okay, I have approximately 5 hours to develop an idea of a screen-saver for MacOS (one of the default modes) and bring it to life. First steps to undertake:
            <br>1. Understand each screen-saver mode system, the order of changing images
            <br>2. Choose one mode to work with
            <br>3. Comprehend the rhythm and choose a direction (modularity? text? storytelling?)

        I've chosen shifting tiles preset and decided to experiment with modularity, as long as this mode allows to create a whole image out of a predefined set of details.
        <br>
        <br>In relation to this I've recalled Bruno Munari's 'Useless Machines', a series of kinetic sculptures that are so delicately assembled that they stay in a perpetual oscillation. I am immensely inspired by the image of modules that each second construct a new composition, never the same, always moving. It comes with Kundera's idea of unbearable lightness of being, the inability to stop the moment and the beauty of ephemeral structures, temporality. Want my screen-saver to correspond to it.

            Recalled a little thing I started to work on during a previous term — a modular collection of shapes to construct all alphabet letters.
            <br>
            <br>Maybe I'll give it a try now, without any typographic implications though.
        <div class="chat-time">11:36</div>

    <div class="chat-block size-3">
            <div class="chat-text"><div class="pic-3"><img src="images/4-saver/alphabet-set.png" alt=""></div>
            I turned my alphabet shapes into a set for a saver, and I can already see in Illustrator's artboards layout that it's unlikely to assemble into anything peculiar, especially without overlaying feature (which, I know for sure, is not present in any of the screen-saver modes). But let's check it first and discuss second.

            ATTEMPT 1 (failed) Modular circular lines (deriving from alphabet set)
            <br>
            <br>The problem: badly matching shapes, obvious sews between frames, doesn't look modular, no compositions created in the process, no singular image as a result. Also the wide range of colours even amplifies the feeling of randomness, so I plan to get rid of them before I come up with more meaningful and satisfying palette decision.
            <br>
            <br>What can be done? Filled shapes instead? It may be a solution at least for mismatching contours.

            ATTEMPT 2 (it's getting a bit better) Modular circles (?)
            <br>
            <br>Filled shapes set works way more promising, but apparently there exists a frustrating problem which I can't override yet — for some reason all images I submit in screen-saver folder are cropped, so sews, again, as in a previous case, are too visible.
            <br>
            <br>Another thing to mention — there is still a lack of compositional variety. The contrast, maybe? Other elements should be added?

                I've spent more than an hour trying to code my shapes in Drawbot. Then I realised generative design is absolutely unnecessary here, as I can actually draw everything by hand in Illustrator and it's gonna take less time :'( At least I have a bunch of code-made circles of perfectly red, blue, and yellow colours now.

            ATTEMPT 3, full small rounds added
            <br>(I only had 1/4 and 1/2 before)
            <br>
            <br>Haven't tried it yet though, but it feels like it should enrich my compositions with small highlights.

            <br>I was looking at Ira's making of her Mondrian tiles (rectangular, of course, unlike mine). And at some point I got just a bit curious... What if... it's all about rectangles?
            <br>
            <br>Hi new set! (Python-generated again, because I'm a stubborn bitch flexing a skill to code some fucking coloured geometric primitives, but never mind)

                I FUCKING DID IT.
                <br>
                <br>At the final stage there was only one detail left to fix — stupid cropping problem. The reason turned out to be obvious, even a bit disappointingly. It's a shame I was dumb enough to not take it into consideration earlier, but... EACH TILE PROPORTION IS EQUIVALENT TO MACBOOK SCREEN PROPORTIONS. Which are (a kindly reminder to myself) — 1440x900. So tiles actually DO crop all images in order to fit them.
                <br>
                <br>And yes, now everything works kinda perfect.

            I would call this entry a post-project note.
            <br>
            <br>There are three things a person can watch forever: water, fire, and my screen-saver assembling in an endless variety of ways, each and every time surprising me. I want to continue working on this project and take a different visual direction. Mainly — to develop something less resembling De Stijl, but still exploring the possibilities of modularity, pushing it to the extremes, yet featuring the beautiful simplicity and elegance of geometric shapes.
            <br>
            <br>But coming back to the topic: isn't it a destructive success that I use my own set of images as a screen-saver?
