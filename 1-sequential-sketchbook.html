        <div class="chat-text">Yesterday we were briefed for 'Sequential Sketchbook' project. The idea amazes me. I can't stop thinking of graphic design workshop at Letnyaya Shkola and keep track of possible exercises. This one may become a foundation for an everyday image-making practice.
        <br>
        <br>The ‘Sequential Sketchbook’ is about responding visually or conceptually to the image from the previous day. The first image may be everything you would like it to be, from the most favorite photograph to the exquisite flower. Throughout this everyday practice you gradually develop the idea and watch it transforms. Mind is an unlimited source of creative energy.

        I was once doing cinema, literature, design, animation, illustration, photography. I studied history, technology, philosophy, music. I've built, engineered, repaired. What kind of fascinating things I am able to create? How immense is my potential field of approaches?

        <br>Art is not a competition.
        <br>
        <br>Art is curiosity.
        <br>
        <br>I should make art not to outperform, but to comprehend. The play of recombinations is my biggest power.

        It seems like I've finally found a perfect treatment of my sequential sketchbook: Anton Reva, photography, collage, El Lissitzky, typography, letter as a shape. Hopefully I will start today, right away. And I assign this sword photograph as my first reference of choice—a stark and strong image from my self-portrait mood-board, circa 2012.

            How these images do refer to a previous one? Through shapes rearranged in an order with new hierarchy. The first composition is, of course, a sword broken down to parts and compiled into a different entity (line, cross, ball, triangulated surface are all taken from a sword, if you look closer). The second collage continues the compositional dynamic, but integrates the photographic element, which I want to accentuate further.

            All these results are totally unsatisfying. I should approach it from a different angle. I am not engaged, not curious. These are meaningless and boring ways to treat imagery surface, they don't explore or inspect, and, after all, just look insipid. I may want to switch to analogue from digital media. It is an unpredictable natural force, therefore so charming — it always allows chance to intervene in a conceived plan. Surprise in entertaining. And entertainment is exactly a proper attitude to develop for this project.

        Every morning I want to enter a workplace with an inkjet printer, acrylic paints, pencils, paper of various textures and colours, and start my transformational experiments. I'm not even going to attempt to build such space at home. I need more space and chaos I don't want to tolerate at my living room which I want to keep tidy and comfortable. At this exact point many people start to rent a studio. It may be my case as well, especially if Masha will support our old dream to establish co-working practice.
        <br>
        <br>I feel difficult because I don't store my works anywhere, I don't have an archive, I don't understand what I've done in my life at all, what I can do, what is worth showing to other people. I just want to be like Anton Reva within my interests (my role-model, honestly). I assume this is the only way to approach my instagram representation: work, diary, portfolio, rare self-portraits.
        <br>
        <br>For some reason I grew shy in terms of my works. Something I couldn't expect from myself. After Britanka, all these shrooms I've eaten, all the social braveness I've learned throughout the previous year? I should work more. With many aspects. I come back to dissatisfaction with myself and creative anxiety, and I definitely don't like it.

            Art is a habit. It's not a talent, not a flame inside, not a gift, but a habit. I once thought that 'real artists' cannot stop creating. Poetic and romanticised construct — artist as a natural born destiny. Now I see: you either have a habit to turn your experiences into a form of art, or you don't. This is the only difference.
            <br>
            <br>Here's Anton Reva who had developed an approach to imagery processing during one year in Saint Martins College, and kept working with conveyer persistence, and eventually turned into a machine for analogue experiments.
            <br>
            <br>Here's me, who was drawing on a daily basis till 18 years old, until I started my college education. Also I was keeping a diary and wanted to write novels based on this experience. I thought of myself as of a writer just because I was indeed writing. Because I had a habit to do it all the time.
            <br>
            <br>If you treat art as a habit, the only thing you have to do now is to bring this habit back to your routine. And apply all the newfound healthy artistic approaches to it.

            Something inside me is burning with anticipation to create images. I am ready to experiment. I want to explore sheer process of it. I want to combine techniques and mediums, photography and typography. I should start collecting materials. A trash that can be collaged. Text. Pieces of textures, drawing leftovers. Instead of throwing these things away, I may pile them. Last year I was liberating myself, this year I have to start searching for my own visual language.

            This Saturday I finally bought an inkjet printer that doesn't need cartridges to top-up ink. It feels amazing to earn money by yourself and spend it the way you want.
            <br>
            <br>Yesterday I was experimenting with two types of paper. Water-soluble ink flows and smears exactly the way I want. Cartridge paper sustains more manipulations, but writing paper shines through due to its thinness, which allows to work with the back side of the sheet.
            <br>
            <br>I like the idea to print on paper made for different purposes. For example: baking paper, receipt paper, instructions, book pages, sticker notes, cotton paper, tracing paper, packages, palettes, posters, advertisement, cash. I definitely have to start collecting all these papers in a special box.
            <br>
            <br>My main plan for tomorrow is to come up with a list of materials, paper kinds, and techniques, and try something new everyday while working on Sequential Sketchbook.

            The big list of components to combine and result with an image every day. 
            <br>
            <br>What is good about it is that it liberates you from thinking and decision-making. The need to make a decision each time you have to compose a picture is stressful, truly. Stress leads to procrastination, so you better arrange your creative process in a way to avoid uncertainty. As I assume, this approach allows more fun and easiness to arise.

            <br>Here's my starting point, a reference point (fig.1 by Anton Reva).

            <br>
            <br>A very old tracing paper used for this image — I took a sheet of it from a fashion magazine issued circa 1905. A feature I noticed — this paper is so thin that paint soaks through and leaves traces on a surface below. It may become my technique of choice for day 2.

            Another rule I've made for myself is using each photograph several times. It is impossible to reveal the potential of an image in a transformational process undertaken just once.
            <br>
            <br>Same tracing paper as yesterday. It is difficult and challenging to work with a material that fragile — too easy to tear it, to jam in a printer (already happened once), but the results are spellbindingly sensual. Here I only soaked the background area to achieve, firstly, the hollowness instead of the silhouette, and secondly — to emphasise the iridescent shining of multicoloured wall behind M.

            My beautiful boy, naked. Originally — with me sitting on top, but I decided to get rid of the sexual connotation and turn Shia's emotion into a denial or the experience of terror and/or confusion. I like it how collaging allows you to treat your initial material as a brick to build literally anything, everything imaginable.
            <br>
            <br>Here I incorporated found text (same old magazine) into my photographic dimension, but I was too shy to try something more severe in terms of visual aberration. This is definitely yet a field to explore — how text and typography can affect collage meaning/emotional context.

            <br>
            <br>Working in series of two images for now seems the best decision. I keep myself hungry and curious, yet do enough work to feel satisfied, all along not losing my need to develop this approach and techniques further tomorrow.

            <br>For these two collages I've used book pages. The first one is a complete disappointment — weak composition, vague colours, boring page layout. The second one, however, I find a total success. Not only due to its compositional beauty that has occurred by a mere chance (finger pointing to 'Contents'), but also because my printer suddenly jammed the sheet and smeared the paint chaotically, which resulted in an outcome that I myself could've neither predict nor achieve on purpose. Chance is a friend, resort to chance if possible!

            Marlboro package series, as I call it. I definitely love mirroring and colour-blocking here, but the trick may be too obvious and doesn't make much sense in terms of visual experimentation. It was my moment of weakness and inability to come up with less predictable idea.

            Overlays and overprints. The first is mirroring applied four times in all possible directions, the second is more random, but I like it more eventually. I think it's all about the magnetic energy of human's face — it always accumulates attention around itself. This is why I am not interested in working with photographs without human figures on them — they simply can't affect us emotionally with the same intensity.

        I grow more and more interested in the phenomena of sloth and idleness in the context of art. What is laziness in creativity? It seems like unwillingness to make effort to extract something from yourself. Because usually people are focused on extraction. One cannot just relax and write a short simple text. You feel obliged to give birth to a big and elaborated piece of work. This is the moment where fear and procrastination emerge—too much responsibility is always terrifying.
        <br>
        <br>All these maximalist mindsets lead to artistic idleness. Creation is fun! This is the most important principle to learn. This is the idea to preserve and nurture in people after childhood. In the beginning you are fuelled by your natural child's spontaneity, but as a teenager you should raise a conceptual foundation in yourself to keep creating freely and with pure joy.

            Book pages overlays. I printed photograph on one side, but used the ghost-image of the opposite one as an outcome, as I've found once again that unintended may turn out more interesting than purposeful. How to incorporate more occurrences of chance in my working process?

            Today I decided to highlight the initial complementarity of two primaries with paint, although usually I transform image with colour instead of simply emphasising it. But here I was from the very beginning spellbound with the simplicity of palette, so why ruin it?

            Book-like, illustrative transformations. Red and green emphasise each other with gentle grace and power. The secret here is paper — I've found Soviet art album and took out a few thick glossy sheets. This paper is the only surface that allows paint to dilute but not smear (the only of those I've tried yet). Contrast of light and shadow stays, colours fade. Unachievable effect, a unique case. It's a shame I don't have more of it to continue my experimentation.

            <br>Constructing new spaces. Based on the photographs of my room in the morning: charming geometry of dawn light and ceiling surface.

        Today I was occupied with collaging for sequential sketchbook for the whole day. Bad news: I work for the process, not the result, paying more attention to exploration of new techniques rather than creating finished works. Good news: I know that I don't like working with the material I've already used for any other purposes. If only I undertook a photo-shooting specifically for collaging, everything would have been different. But thereby I revealed a new reason to take more and better photos. God knows how much I love analogue processing.
        <br>
        <br>I started working with found paper and plan to continue. This is the sweetest part of my work: to look how 110 year old  tracing paper would be affected by water; to smear modern printer paint over soviet glossy album book sheets; to work with back side of an image, creating a collage on a thin writing paper.
        <br>
        <br>Old paper adds value to my prints—in this way they become truly unique. Paper is everything. The whole magic of the process depends on a paper. It behaves differently, unpredictably each and every time. I am endlessly curious. Now I perfectly imagine the motivation of going to old abandoned paper factories to find precious wastes.

            Surprisingly, but although I didn't plan any of these things occur, somehow both images turned out looking like the 90s cheesy pank-like collages. However, I'm still fond of Shia's portrait here. Tracing paper soaked leftovers again.

            I want to finish this project with a self-portrait. Because what was it, if not a portrait of me? How brave I became throughout this month, how much fear and fun I had experienced in order to complete this sketchbook, how beautiful this revelation of liberation turned out eventually. 
            <br>
            <br>Yes, this is my self-portrait in 34 images. And I wish I would be able continue this practice even after our final crit.
