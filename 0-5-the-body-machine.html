            Today we started a new project, 'The Body Machine'. I was given a finger to research. Finger is not as intriguing as penis, or anus, or vagina, but finger can visit many places and witness many things.
            <br>
            <br>Finger as an identifier. Fingerprints.
            <br>
            <br>Finger as an eye in the world of tactility. It allows to recognise things with a touch without directly looking at them.
            <br>
            <br>Finger as a gesture, silent language.
            <br>
            <br>Finger as sex object. It can be put in any hole, it can lure and caress.
            <br>
            <br>And also there are five different fingers.

            <br>
            <br>Fingers also can imitate penis, if they are being painted by Shia.

        Analysis of the finger anatomy gave me approximately nothing, except for the fact that I realised that fingerprint is the most visually rich part of the finger and can be an aspect to focus on and develop.

            While in Kyiv, I should prepare all templates for screen-printing and laser-cutting, to get back to Moscow and start physically working on a project right away. The first outcome is the biggest part of my plan: I want to try to make a squared print of a fingerprint pattern on a black velvet fabric piece of A0 format in a variety of paints (flock, puff, neoprene).
            <br>
            <br>The second one should be interesting as well: I am to make a relieved labyrinth based on a fingerprint pattern out of plaster, preferably—a series of three.
            <br>
            <br>The third one remains a mystery. I am too stupid to Python-code the program to generate fingerprint patterns, but at the same time less interested in body extensions or thimbles, which were my options previously. There still remains a possibility to develop finger language, but I my development is stuck.

            <br>Still haven't started anything, but keep thinking of my third outcome.
            <br>
            <br>Fingerspelling (or dactylology) is the representation of the letters of a writing system, and sometimes numeral systems, using only the hands. I'm curious on how complex this system can be, considering a very limited set of fingers to operate.
            <br>
            <br>The trickiest part of my project is that I cannot use several fingers to illustrate meaning, as I have 'a finger', not 'a hand'. Therefore I can either design a system based on a particular finger gestures (differently graduated extents of a fold), or reduce it to five gestures of each finger sticking out, while four others are forming a fist.

            <br>I've figured out three directions for the language-based outcome:

            <br>1. Posters without using words to illustrate collocations that employ fingers as a metaphor
            <br>2. Representation of letters in differently folded fingers; a set of wooden stamps to create words (but what is the purpose of this device if words can be written with alphabetic letters?)
            <br>3. Posters to show the meaning of each finger sticking out, series of five

            I'm in Britanka crisis again, wohoo! It will be a huge surprise to complete my works by the installing of 'The Body Machine' pop-up show, as I don't have anything at all yet.
            <br>
            <br>Based on my previous screen-printing experience, I can predict that producing of just one print will take about two or three days. And there are also laser-cutting (to undertake) and ceramics (to research and start making).
            <br>
            <br>An amazing time-management, isn't it, Rante?

            Decided to use lasercut stencil (instead of screen-printing) and spray paint. It solves lots of problems, as it seems for me now. I only have to choose a right fabric.
            <br>
            <br>What is good about it: I can produce several prints based on the same stencil in various colour palettes in 2-3 hours.
            <br>
            <br>The most difficult part is laser-cutting, as always. Luckily I still have my 1,5 m plexiglass sheet that I initially planned to use for Foundation final major project. It can be cut faster and finer than plywood.
            <br>
            <br>I'm wondering if it possible to produce my 3D-outcome out of plexiglass? More likely I don't have enough of it for both, but what if...

            Scanned Shia's fingers to trace patterns. Insane, but each finger has its own unique print! I didn't know that they vary not from person to person, but from finger to finger.

        <br>
        <br>It was looking differently in my head... What is the problem, actually? Should the lines be more even? Resemble a vectorised abstraction rather than an irregular natural pattern? I even retraced the initial stage and simplified it, but apparently it needs to be simplified even more.

                Feeling myself very depressed. I guess due to the fact that I couldn't produce anything within a last week. When your attempts don't result in anything, your energy level goes down two times faster than usually, and you get unbearably tired by 6 PM. I don't understand why I haven't started working on the outcomes in advance. I could never understand it, but it happens every single time, always the same scenario. Want to be expelled from Britanka again. My most common reaction to the failure, unluckily.

            <br>The first one is based on a fingerprint I scanned and traced.
            <br>The second is taken from Google as an example of 'double-loop' type of a fingerprint. After all I decided to stick to the idea of illustrating three of six existing types. Two more to go.
            <br>
            <br>I don't really have time now to register all my decision transformations, but, in short, I moved to ceramics idea instead of plaster cast-outs after consulting with a technician. She told me that I will unlikely end up with a clean result, and also there will be no chance to coat it with glaze (which, of course, adds a beautiful glossy finish to the outcome). So here I am—making tiles with my own hands, and for now it seems the funniest part of the whole project.

            <br>The stencil I planned to use for spray-paint printing eventually turned out a handy thing to:
            <br>
            <br>1. Check if I have all required details of a composition (initially I didn't, but I detected it before leaving laser-cutting machine)
            <br>2. Transfer the location of details to the board for proper sticking
            <br>
            <br>Although I had this idea of stencil printing, now I realise it was impossible from the very beginning to execute it neatly (fig.2 is the best showcase of a technique).

            <br>Spent the whole day on sticking parts to the board; found out my ceramic tiles had cracked after firing, and the glaze is bubbling all over the surface; and overall everything is disastrously fucked up.
            <br>
            <br>I could've never imagined how long it takes for wood glue to dry, and throughout this whole process the parts should be pressed together with a pile of books (or something else as heavy). A friendly reminder to myself from the future: stop working with thin warped plywood if you don't want to waste 10 hours on gluing alone.

            Kind of last-minute-outcome. I've designed these posters tonight, a day before the exhibition, based on photographs of my own hands. My motto should be something stereotypical like 'never give up, fight until there is still a tiny chance of winning'.

        <br>Despaired enough to print images of different colours with the same screen in a lazy attempt to split two paints (unsuccessful, but you can't disagree that lime and lemon can be considered almost the same hue if you don't have time for two screens).
