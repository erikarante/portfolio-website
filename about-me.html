            This website is a development of messenger metaphor that automatically defined all subsequent design and textual decisions. As Telegram became my sample model to mimic, the idea of text object as a log followed respectively: I keep track of my work-related thoughts in a form of a Telegram diary, therefore it is logical to represent my portfolio in the form most natural for me, but this time speculative.  
            <br>
            <br>In a need to systemise several complex projects within one chat interface, I had chosen channels structure to impose on the existent content. Channels allowed me to split information into secular chats that don't interfere with each other, and to create parallel chronological diary narratives for each of my projects.
            <br>
            <br>The choice of text stylisation gave me room not only for purely informative entries, but also for sharing references, research, emotions, long reflections on my practice and graphic design in general. I translated some of my real diary texts into English and intertwined them with fictional ones. Thereby the website partially turned into multilayered portrait or autobiographical piece, featuring both actual and desirable states of my personality.
            <br>
            <br>As a chaotic archive with non-linear scenario of reading, the website becomes a playground for embedded distraction, engaging the visitor to scroll, switch between channels, look at images, read some entries or none of them, and overall to perform in the same familiar way we all are used to as messenger users.
