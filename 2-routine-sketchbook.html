            Today was the end of the sequential sketchbook project. We were introduced to a new brief — routine sketchbook. I like this new idea more: each of us should choose a system of documenting the same object/action/time span and register it every day throughout the month with any preferable medium.
            <br>
            <br>My groupmates now tend to choose photography majorly, but I decided to use this brief as a reason to start drawing on a daily basis. It is way easier when you don't have to look for a subject — you just picture whatever happens in a chosen location/hour. Unlike the sequential sketchbook, there is no space to experiment with materials, but only consistent observation.
            <br>
            <br>I plan to pick two times (morning and evening), set alarms for these hours, and draw anything I would be looking at by the time the alarm rings. The exact time should be something like 14-00 and 18-00, because, I guess, most of the interesting events happen to me in the middle of the day, rather than in the beginning or end.
            <br>
            <br>Tomorrow I'm gonna try my material of choice — oil pastels. I really hope the inaccuracy of this tool will eventually liberate me from a fear to draw something ugly. The only aspect I worry about is Britanka — I don't want to find myself on a session when my alarm rings, because in this case I wouldn't be able to draw the scene right away. Have to test time as well before picking anything in particular.

            Due to the fact that I don't practice image-making, I don't have my own style. I definitely have a photographic style and a specific approach to my texts, because I am used to it. I don't ask myself how to take a photo of an object to maintain my vision.
            <br>
            <br>But drawings are also very important. I feel like they can teach me a lot more and influence my art. I am now in a stage of approaching a new period of my creative life, I am sure of it. And I need to cross this line to find myself on the other side of this chasm. Because thinking about my idleness keep hurting me every time I let myself consider this aspect of being.

                An exercise—depicting the same object in different surrounding. Routine process yet I love the result and how context affect the perception of a chosen thing.

        <br>14:00 — Compiling a presentation of a fictional exhibition devoted to art of mentally ill people (for C&CS). Based on Yayoi Kusama as a starting point. Henry Darger is amazing, by the way. In a sense that he approaches his absolutely schizophrenic idea (speaking of 'The Story of the Vivian Girls', of course) with such passion and elaboration, that the extent of absurdity eventually becomes fascinating.
        <br>18:00 — Screen-printing 'Added Value' condom posters, the first layer of the first poster ('Threesome'). Trembling with anticipation, because what I see now already blows up my mind (with beauty).

        <br>
        <br>I was way too busy having fun to depict my life at 18:00. But I don't want to lie to my sketchbook, so the pages I couldn't fill right away would stay empty.

        My sketchbook routine officially came to an end, and as I am being now occupied with 'The Body Machine' project and the upcoming pop-show + assessment, I doubt that I can afford drawing on a daily basis from now on. But I loved this practice so much! And it changed me radically as an artist, made me love depicting my surroundings again! Next step is to incorporate this experience in my ordinary life and probably try to mix oil pastels with more mediums (gouache, watercolour, pencils).
